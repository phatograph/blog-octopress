Ahh, editors, a wand of developers. I have use several of them since I began
my job as a coder. Some are complex IDE, some are simple text editors. Let's
take some years back.

> PS. For those who might wonder wtf these section headers are,
I try to map my lifetime with my favourite childhood
[card game](http://www.essentialmagic.com/CARDSETS/Default.asp) ;)

### The Dark

I didn't code anything when I was in highschool. I didn't understand coding
at all. There was a computer class by then assigned me some Pascal homework
(I think It was Pascal .. can't really remember) and some very basic HTML without
any CSS.

Before I chose my major as Computer Science I was confusing between an archtect,
an engineer, even a dentist. That time I was playing a MMORPG game and I was
introduced a botting system (that was evil .. I'm sorry).
I started configure some script and loved it.
So I chose this CS major. Until this day, I know by myself I didn't make a
wrong choice ;)

### Ice Age

Ahh once a CS freshies. In the first year there was a programming class
coding some **C** basics using [LCC-win32](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~lcc-win32/)
and I think that was my first IDE. I didn't understand anything,
syntax ? compiling ? `int void main()` ? Everything seemed to be too scary.

The next language was **Java** using [Netbeans](https://netbeans.org/)
5 or 6 I guess, first met with OOP. Even I could perform in the exam quite well,
I still didn't really understand what programming is.

### Coldsnap

Later years in CS there was a Computer System class and I had a chance
to write some **Assembly** scripts, but I totally forget the tools I used.
Same as tools for OS, AI, Logic and Functional Programming classes,
I remember once I wrote **Haskell** and **Lisp**, but don't know how.
Netbeans was still there used to write Java applets in Computer Graphics class.

I did my senior project in Computer Vision field using [Matlab](http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/).
That was really weird for me right now, as a Web Developer.
Since then I havn't had a chance to work in this field anymore, and I'm happy with that.

### Tempest

I was graduated! But sadly I couldn't write any solid usable program.
So I applied for a doctoral scholarship. (Un?)fortunately I was rejected
and become lost. At that time my friend @chakrit and some others were working
at the startup company. Thus he invited me to join.

I was taught to write some basic frontend before, so I became a frontend guy
at the company.

My life with web development has begun by then.

.. And also my relationship with M$ Visual Studio, 2008 by that time.

### Stronghold

At the time being, grid-based **CSS** frameworks were becoming polular.
I studied [Blueprint](http://www.blueprintcss.org/) and tried to understand
the idea. And based on that, I created my very first framework,
the [Draftsman](https://github.com/phatograph/draftsman)'s grid.
I have learnt most of my skills from [Nettuts](net.tutsplus.com),
[David Walsh](http://davidwalsh.name/), [Chris Coyier](http://chriscoyier.net/)
and other blogs as well.

Apart from **ASP.net MVC (C#)** (beta or 1) projects, which were company's cores,
I also responsibled in some **PHP** projects. I used [CodeIgniter](http://ellislab.com/codeigniter)
in Netbeans for PHP and it worked great, though quite slow but acceptable.

### Saga

After a year I left my first company and joined a bigger one, much bigger.
I was still a frontend guy but this time the UI team I was in use
**ASP.net WebForm**.

Couple of months passed and the company upgraded VS
from 2008 to 2010. Seriously, I had hard times with the IDE since
the solution was very huge and complex, and my machine got only 2Gb RAM.
VS2010 usually hangs up and crashed when I started multitasking.
Things got slightly better when boosted up to 4Gb (whlist WinXP could
only use 3.xGb) but sometimes with 3+ times hang-in-a-row I just
want to throw something.

Meanwhile I became interested in **JavaScript** much more. I had been written
some **jQuery** since first company. But in the project it used **Prototype.js**,
some RC or beta version. I upgraded it to 1.7.x and learnt some lessons
along the way. I found out that, for me, many JS fundamental were hard
to understand and remember, so I started [blogging](http://blog.phatograph.com/index.php/tag/javascript/)
about them.

Blogging has become really helpful for me since then.

### Destiny

I decided to bought myself my first [Macbook](http://support.apple.com/kb/sp619).
The reason was because I had been reading articles about JavaScript
and discovered **Node.js**. I really wanted to try them out. At when I was diciding to buy
it turned out my sister needed a laptop for her homework, so I gave her
my [old one](http://shop.lenovo.com/us/laptops/ideapad/y-series/y450) and
bought the beloved Macbook. And began to fall in love with Unix.

After Node.js I wanted to try our more things. What is NoSQL ? Just try it,
MongoDB, CouchDB. **CoffeeScript** ? Sounds nice, try it. I wrote some simple **Django**
and **Ruby on Rails** projects. At that time I heard about a company
hiring a Rails guy, I was interested, and got myself deeper in Rails.

Gah I totally forget about Editors.
One stupid reason for me to but a Mac is I wanted to use TextMate.
I tried it trial, nice, and swtich to Coda, hmm quite well too. But
I don't want to pay for a license. Then there was Sublime 2, which
I thought its package management is really awesome. So it became my
main editor in OSX.

### Invasion

Three years with ASP.net C#, I decided to leave it.
I joined the Rails company and became much more serious about Rails,
and the web technologies.

So much things to learn everyday, [Heroku](heroku.com) is my hosting choice
also with self-managed VPS on [DigitalOcean](digitalocean.com).
CI service by [TravisCI](travis-ci.org/), special thanks for deploying this
blog!

I have become more familiar and prefer **Git** and Version Control system
(I also prefer GUI based with [SourceTree](http://sourcetreeapp.com/).
**SVN** is also fine, if I have to.
I use BitBucket for private projects, GitHub for open sources, and
[Unfuddle](https://unfuddle.com/) for SVN.

Since I have a good feeling with console using [iTerm2](http://www.iterm2.com/),
one crazy day I forced myself to drop Sublime and began using Vim. I want
to use it for a long time but I couldn't, always fell asleep when reading tutorials.
This time I tried to use it in a daily processes. With a help from
my genius friend @chakrit I slowly get used to it more and more.
Now I even have my own [dotfiles](https://github.com/phatograph/dotfiles).
I'm very happy that I'm happy with Vim.

### Planeshift

For now Rails is my first weapon of choice, follow by Node.js, PHP,
and still ASP.net MVC I guess. Many should come by and I'm still
happy with this wab development thingy eveyday. It's good to
recall old memories and take a look back what I have done in this career path.
And I have a thought with myself that I'll keep going, higher and higher
everyday.

The sky is a limit, developers.
