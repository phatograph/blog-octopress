After 2 years relationship with [wordpress](http://blog.phatograph.com/) I've decided to move along. This time I kinda want a more *simple* and *static* blogging system. I've heard about [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) and [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) since I started working with ruby a year ago and that time I had no idea how to use it. Now I quite understand how things work in this static-generated blogging much more, and I choose Octopress first.

Next up would be porting posts from the old blog. Oh yeah and this time I feel more comfortable to write things in English. Things changed, I've grown up, at least that's what I think.

Once, hello again, Octopress ;)
